Greetings! My name is Guanming Liu, a third-year master's student from Tongji University, majoring in computer science and technology. My research interests lie in multi-modal image generation and implicit neural representation, especially on GAN/Diffusion models. Now I am a research intern focusing text-to-image generation on Ele.me, Alibaba Group.

Future
======
I will graduate from Tongji University in May 2024, looking forward to related PhD positions!
