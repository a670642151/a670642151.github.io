Greetings! My name is Guanming Liu, a master student from **Tongji University**, majoring in computer science and technology. My research interests lie in **multi-modal image generation** and **implicit neural representation**, especially on **GAN/Diffusion models**. 

News
======

* The paper "Extending Implicit Neural Representations for Text-to-Image Generation" is accepted by ICASSP 2024.
* I am exploring an image evaluation metric based on multi-modal contrastive models like CLIP and signal frequency analysis to calculate the topology discrepancies.
* Ramping up for my next TOEFL bout! ðŸš€ðŸ“šðŸ’ª
