Greetings! My name is Guanming Liu, a third-year master's student from **Tongji University**, majoring in computer science and technology. My research interests lie in **multi-modal image generation** and **implicit neural representation**, especially on **GAN/Diffusion models**. 

News
======
* Now I am a research intern focusing text-to-image generation on Ele.me, Alibaba Group.

* The paper "Extending Implicit Neural Representations for Text-to-Image Generation" is under submission.
